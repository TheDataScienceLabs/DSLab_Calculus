    "### I2C\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually a modern electronic device will consist of a *microcontroller* (such as the Raspberry Pi Pico) and several *peripherals*. \"Peripherals are what we call any component the microcontroller is \"in charge\" of. The two main peripherals we will be using in our inclinometer are a screen and an accelerometer. You might call the button a peripheral, but usually the word peripheral refers to components which do something on their own, while communicating with the microcontroller.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular ways for a microcontroller to communicate with a peripheral is using a protocol called the Inter-Integrated-Circuit protocol. Its name is usually abbreviated, either as IIC, I²C, or simply I2C. These are pronounced as \"eye-eye-see\", \"eye-squared-see\" or \"eye-two-see\" respectively. I2C uses two wires, one called Serial Clock (abbreviated as SCL) and the other called Serial Data (abbreviated SDA). One of the brilliant things about I2C is that every I2C peripheral has its own identification number, so when a message is sent using the I2C protocol it can have a label saying \"who it is for\". That means you can have several different peripherals all connected to the same two wires -- potentially connecting dozens of peripherals to a microcontroller using only two wires (assuming none of the devices share an identification number). Since many devices are sharing the same connection an I2C connection is called a \"bus\", from the Latin *Omnibus* which means \"for everyone\". I2C is an example of a *serial* communication protocol, because bits of data are sent one after another (in a series) over relatively few wires, instead of all-at-once over relatively many wires. You have already heard of, and used, another serial bus protocol -- the so-called Universal Serial Bus, usually abbreviated as USB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Raspberry Pi Pico has two I2C busses, numbered 0 and 1. You can see which pins they are connected to on the Pico's datasheet; for example, to use I2C bus number 0, you can use any of the GP pins labeled as I2C0 SCL and I2C0 SDA. For example, GP pins (20 & 21), or (12 & 13), or (4 & 5). \n",
    "\n",
    "When you set up an I2C bus, you will have to choose a frequency for it to use. This is a fairly straightforward decision. The valid choices of frequency are 100,000; 400,000; 1,000,000; 1,700,000; and 3,400,000 Hertz. If you use a higher frequency then your system will run faster and consume more power. Higher frequencies might not work, depending on several factors such as how long your wires are and how much electromagnetic interference they experience. However, not all peripherals will continue to function properly if the frequency is too high, so because speed is not necessarily important to us, we will stick with 400,000 hertz. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The framebuffer\n",
    "\n",
    "On the hardware side, we interact with the OLED display using I2C. In software, the interface we will use is one of the interfaces built into Micropython: the frame buffer interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called a frame buffer because when interacting with it, you make most of your changes in an array called a buffer, stored on the Pico. We only send data to the display when we call the function `show()`, as a complete frame ready to display. This way, we are using the I2C bus as little as possible, freeing up time for other peripherals to use the I2C bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation for the frame buffer interface is [part of the Micropython documentation](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/framebuf.html). There you will find functions for drawing lines, rectangles, and text, as well as a function for writing to individual pixels. It is important to note that pixels on the screen are referenced based on their horizontal and vertical distance from the top left corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two clocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the easiest way to learn a new tool is to see it used. As an example, we have provided two programs (which you have installed earlier) that do the same thing using the OLED display. [procedural_clock.py](https://github.com/TheDataScienceLabs/DSLab_Calculus/blob/main/book/labs/4_measure_tall_things/b_build_an_inclinometer/scripts/procedural_clock.py) draws a clock on the display by performing a sequence of actions one after another, inside a `while True` loop. [classy_clock.py](https://github.com/TheDataScienceLabs/DSLab_Calculus/blob/main/book/labs/4_measure_tall_things/b_build_an_inclinometer/scripts/classy_clock.py) does the exact same steps, but wraps everything to do with the display into one class and defines methods on the class to do the various parts. Note that in practice you would usually define any classes you are using in a separate module, and import those classes into your main file. We have chosen to put the class definition at the bottom of the file to make it easier for you to compare them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of what they do, both of these programs are identical. Their difference lies in how easy they are to read and how easy they are to modify.\n",

Naively, we might think an accelerometer would tell us nothing about a stationary object, except that it is stationary. As it turns out, that naive view is incorrect because of general relativity. As it turns out, the effect of gravity also shows up in our measurements as an acceleration. If you wish to learn more about this, you can see [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAtRD9_4Oa0) which has helpful animations, or [this more impassioned video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vng2-R64rAY) from a professional physicist who presents the limits of this interpretation of gravity.

    "- 9 volts is more than any part of the Pico can handle. If you connect the battery directly you will damage the microcontroller. We need to use another component to convert the voltage to a range the Pico can handle.\n",
    "- It is not safe to power the Pico from more than one source at a time. That means you must not connect the Pico to a computer while it is powered by a battery, and you must not connect a battery while it is connected to a computer.\n",

    "Before running your inclinometer from a battery, here is a question: how will we start the program without using Thonny? The inclinometer needs to run without being connected to a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the trick we will use: when the Pico powers on, the first thing it does is check its memory for a file called `main.py`. If there is a file with that name, it runs the file. So there is our solution: make a file called `main.py` which starts the inclinometer. Or just rename the file we already have. The important thing is that the file is called `main.py`, and it's actually stored on the microcontroller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing make sure you have your inclinometer starting whenever it gets connected to power. You should be able to plug the the microcontroller into any USB port and watch it start up automatically without doing anything on the computer. Once you have this, you can move on to powering it by battery.\n",

To convert the power coming from the battery to a voltage we can use, we will use one of the most common, cheap voltage regulators available: the 7805.
