    "In Exercise 8 you should have found that the symmetric difference scheme gave exactly the right answer. This is not just a coincidence.

Data often arrive whenever they are available, and we have to deal with that. Fortunately, we can still get a second-order accurate scheme, even if the step sizes are unequal. In this section, we will develop a second-order accurate scheme to estimate the derivative of a function at a point $x=b$ using nearby points $x=a$ to the left and $x=c$ to the right, so $a<b<c$.

The difference in speed is very small for arrays without very many entries, but when we start to have hundreds or thousands of entries in our arrays it makes a huge difference.
