    "In Exercise 8 you should have found that the symmetric difference scheme gave exactly the right answer. This is not just a coincidence. Whenever your function is a quadratic polynomial, the symmetric finite difference scheme gives exactly the correct answer. A scheme with this property is called **second-order accurate**.\n",

Data often arrive whenever they are available, and we have to deal with that. Fortunately, we can still get a second-order accurate scheme, even if the step sizes are unequal. In this section, we will develop a second-order accurate scheme to estimate the derivative of a function at a point $x=b$ using nearby points $x=a$ to the left and $x=c$ to the right, so $a<b<c$.
