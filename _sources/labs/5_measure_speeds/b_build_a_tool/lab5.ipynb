    "Today we will start out with an ultrasonic distance sensor, called the SR04. It has a simple interface using only two pins. It sends out a very high-frequency sound (at a much higher frequency than anyone can hear) and listens for an echo. We can use the time delay between when the \"chirp\" happens and when we hear the echo to figure out how far away something is.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this sensor, you will need:\n",
    "1. A Raspberry Pi Pico\n",
    "2. A level shifter\n",
    "3. An SR04 distance sensor\n",
    "4. A breadboard\n",
    "5. at least a dozen jumper wires of several colors.\n",
    "6. A micro USB cable\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by gathering the parts!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wire it up\n",
    "Insert the pico, level shifter, and SR04 into the bread board so that the jumper wires you have will reach between them. You will also want the micro USB port to be accessible, and you will need the SR04 to be pointed outward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, use jumper wires to make the following connections:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pico**| **Level shifter**\n",
    "-|-\n",
    "GND | GND (low voltage side)\n",
    "GND | LV3\n",
    "GND | LV4\n",
    "3V3(OUT) | LV\n",
    "VBUS | HV\n",
    "(any GP pin) | LV1\n",
    "(any other GP pin) | LV2\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**SR04** | **Level shifter**\n",
    "-|-\n",
    "GND (high voltage side) | GND\n",
    "VCC | HV\n",
    "TRIG | HV1\n",
    "ECHO | HV2\n",
    "\n",
    "The level shifter and SR04 are labeled with their pins. Remember that you can look up the names of the pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico by consulting its datasheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before you plug the Raspberry Pi Pico into your computer** (which will supply power to your circuit), get your circuit checked by an instructor. If you have it wired incorrectly, you could damage the computer's USB port.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the level shifter doing?\n",
    "The Raspberry Pi Pico runs all its circuits at 3.3 volts, while the SR04 runs at 5 volts. Luckily, we do have 5 volts available for it (the USB standard includes a 5 volt pin) so we can drive the ultrasonic sensor as long as the Pico is connected to a computer. The level shifter is in charge of translating between the voltage levels, which is why it has a low voltage side connected to 3V3, and a high voltage side connected to VBUS (which refers to the USB cable). We only need to do level shifting to two pins, and it is good practice to connect pins you are not using to ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The software\n",
    "Once you have it wired up, open the file `ultrasonic.py` in Thonny. There are a few things I would like to point out to you in that file.\n",
    "1. We use a `while` loop. A while loop is just like a `for` loop, repeating everything in the body of the loop. Instead of taking values from a list or a range, it just keeps going until its argument is `False`. By saying `while True`, we are telling it to do everything in the body of the loop, over and over, forever (or until we stop it manually). In order to stop this script, you will need to hit the \"Stop\" button in Thonny.\n",
    "2. The Raspberry Pi Pico runs a different version of Python called Micropython. Micropython is designed specifically for microcontrollers. It does not have many of the modules you are used to, like `numpy`, since the Pico does not have enough memory or processing power to make good use of them. Instead, it has libraries for interfacing with hardware, like the `machine` library we will use to control the pins on the Pico. Also, the `time` library in Micropython supports millisecond and microsecond `sleep` functions, which can count out much more precise units of time than you can in normal Python.\n",
    "3. Near the start we define two variables `trig` and `echo`. Each of those takes an integer, which refers to the pin you are using to connect with the SR04. Change the script so that `trig` corresponds to the GP port where you connected LV1, and `echo` with the GP port where you connected LV2. **Note:** the pins are numbered in python according to the green number on the datasheet. For example, the pin numbered in grey on the datasheet as `11` says `GP8` on it, so we would refer to that in Python as pin 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we work through this lab, you will learn what each part of this code does. Before we get into it, go ahead and run the script and see for yourself what it is doing. Move something in front of the sensor, see if you can make the numbers change."
