    "We won't use inheritance very much. Twenty to thirty years ago, when object-oriented programming was still something new, many people were impressed with how easy it was to do inheritance and so they built big, elaborate systems of inheritance. Mostly, the code that came out of that style was a tangled mess, where you could never be entirely sure where all the attributes came from. As a result, inheritance has become much less popular lately. For small things inheritance can still be useful, and many people still use inheritance so it's good to know about it."
