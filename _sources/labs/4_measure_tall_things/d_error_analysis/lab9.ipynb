    "### Accuracy and precision\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between random and systematic errors is often phrased in terms of how accurate a measurement is and how precise a measurement is. Professional scientists and engineers use the words \"accuracy\" and \"precision\" to refer to two different, related concepts. *Accuracy* refers to how close the measurement is to the true value. *Precision* refers to how close repeated measurements are to each other. This is summarized in the following image -- in this metaphor the arrows are our measurements, and the target is the true value.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=accuracy_and_precision.png width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the terms described above, a measurement is accurate if $|\\varepsilon|$ is small. A measurement is precise if $|\\varepsilon|$ is close to its average value. It follows that the accuracy can only be as good as the precision, so we often do want to have good precision. However, as the picture shows, it is possible (and indeed, common) to have lots of precision but not much accuracy. In that case, the precision isn't really doing you any good. The real goal is accuracy. Don't lose sight of that!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two ways of reporting errors\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been talking about the error $\\varepsilon$ directly. This is also called the *absolute error*. This term has nothing to do with absolute value. Absolute error can be positive or negative. The units of absolute error are the same as the units of the measured quantity. A typical ruler has markings down to the 1/16 inch, so interpolating by eye you can make sure the error is less than 1/32 inches. This can be very good for measuring, say, how long your pencil is, since a typical pencil is around 7 inches long. The pencil on my desk is 7 1/8 inches long, $\\pm$ 1/32 inch. I use the symbol $\\pm$ to indicate that I don't know whether my guess is too high or too low. All I can say for sure is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "7\\frac{1}{8} -\\frac{1}{32}< t < 7\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{32}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A ruler like this would not be as appropriate for measuring how wide the pencil is -- it can only tell me it is 1/4 inch wide, $\\pm$ 1/32 inch. To express this idea mathematically, we simply divide the error by the true value $x$ -- or if we don't know the true value, by our best guess. We write this as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\eta = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{t} \\approx \\frac{\\varepsilon}{x}, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "using the greek letter eta ($\\eta$) which also makes an \"e\" sound, though it looks sort of like a lowercase n. This quantity is called the relative error. Unlike the absolute error, the relative error is dimensionless -- it would be the same if we expressed the answer in inches or centimeters or smoots. Relative error is usually expressed as a percentage. For example, the length of my pencil is 7 1/8 inches $\\pm$ 0.44%. The width of my pencil is 1/4 inch $\\pm$ 12.5%. This shows how a ruler is not appropriate for measuring the width of a pencil, but it's fine for measuring the length -- the relative error is significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "We often want an equation relating $t$ and $x$ using the relative error instead of the absolute error. This is easily achieved by factoring:\n",
    "\n",
