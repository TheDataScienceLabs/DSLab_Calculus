It has pictures of five buildings, and a table for you to fill in. Print this out. You will record the measurer's height, the length of rope, and the components of acceleration from your inclinometer. You will only need one inclinometer; choose one from your group to use. **Record the acceleration components directly, not the angle** for reasons which will become clear next week. You need to get at least three measurements of at least three buildings -- a minimum of nine measurements. You can measure them in whatever order you like. If you have time, measure all five buildings but **don't spend more than an hour measuring buildings**. If you only have three buildings measured after an hour, that's fine. Here are some tips which you may find useful:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Measure each group members's height, up to their eyeball. This will be easier to do before you go out, since you can use a tape measure. You may find it helpful to write the measurer's name on the sheet, and fill in the height later.\n",
    " - Move the rope in between each measurement, and take turns measuring. This will reduce the chance of a systematic error, since you will be doing it a little different for each measurement.\n",
    " - If anything unusual happens with a specific measurement, write that down as well. This will make it easier to remember what has happened when you are reviewing the data, and possibly help explain the errors you find.\n",
    " - If you don't have room to lay out your whole rope, fold it in half. Alternately, make marks along your rope at known distances. Make sure to record the method you choose.\n",
    " - Your answers will be more accurate if you place the near end of the rope close to the object you are measuring, and the far end far away.\n",
    " \n",
